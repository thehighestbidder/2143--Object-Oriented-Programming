# H07 - DRY, KISS, and Introduction to SOLID Principles

This folder contains the work for Assignment H07, focusing on the software development principles of DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid), and an introduction to the SOLID principles.

## Contents

* **H07\_Responses.txt**: This file contains the answers to all parts of the assignment, including:
    * Part A: Definitions and examples of DRY and KISS, explanations of two SOLID principles (SRP and OCP), and the importance of SOLID in large codebases.
    * Part B: Minimal pseudo-code examples illustrating a DRY violation and its fix, a simplified approach following KISS, and the application of the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) from SOLID.
    * Part C: Reflection and short discussion on the trade-offs between DRY and readability, combining DRY and KISS, and the necessity of strictly following SOLID in small projects.

* **README.md**: This file (you are currently reading it) provides an overview of the assignment and its contents.

## Assignment Overview

This assignment aimed to solidify understanding of:

* **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Recognizing and eliminating code duplication.
* **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):** Emphasizing simplicity in code design.
* **SOLID Principles:** Introducing fundamental principles for robust and maintainable object-oriented design, with a focus on the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and the Open-Closed Principle (OCP).
* **Practical Application:** Demonstrating these principles through minimal pseudo-code examples.
* **Trade-offs and Context:** Reflecting on the balance between these principles and their applicability in different project sizes.

## Part A: Conceptual Questions

This section addresses the theoretical aspects of DRY, KISS, and the SOLID principles, providing definitions, examples, and explanations of their importance in software development.

## Part B: Minimal Examples or Scenarios

This section provides concise pseudo-code examples to illustrate:

* **DRY Violation & Fix:** Identifying and refactoring repeated code into a more maintainable function.
* **KISS Principle:** Simplifying a complex scenario into a more readable and straightforward solution.
* **SOLID Application (SRP):** Applying the Single Responsibility Principle to a class design by separating distinct responsibilities into different interfaces.

## Part C: Reflection & Short Discussion

This section encourages reflection on the practical application of these principles, including:

* The balance between adhering to DRY and maintaining code readability.
* How DRY and KISS can work together to guide design decisions.
* The necessity of strictly following SOLID principles in projects of different scales.

## Deliverables

All responses and the pseudo-code examples are contained within the `H07_Responses.txt` file. The pseudo-code is presented directly within that text file for easy review. This `README.md` provides a summary of the assignment and its contents.
